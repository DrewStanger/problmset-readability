There are two versions of readbility, one is a C program produced for PSET2, the other being a python version produced for PSET6 these can be used to compute the approximate grade level needed to comprehend a passage of text.

The program works uses the Coleman-Liau index formula to calculate the reading grade.

This was produced during the completion of Havards CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science.
